# Temperature & Air Quality Analysis (Project-1-Elysium)

## Introduction
Project ELYSIUM is an in-depth analysis focusing on the intersection of temperature, precipitation and air quality  patterns across key cities in the United States. By leveraging historical weather data and air quality indices (AQI), this project aims to uncover trends and correlations that can provide valuable insights into the impacts of climate change on urban environments.


## Cities
36.1540, 95.9928 - Tulsa
40.7128, 74.0060 - New York
34.0549, 118.2426 - Los Angeles

## Resources
Historical Weather Data: The data spans from 2014 to 2023, providing daily and quarterly data for temperature, precipitation, and the Air Quality Index (AQI). This extensive dataset, accessible via the Open-Meteo Historical Weather API, allows for a deep dive into historical weather records, helping to identify trends over the past decade.
Air Quality Data: Sourced from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) API, this dataset provides detailed air quality measurements, including key pollutants and AQI values.

We chose data from the EPA and open metro because it is based on accurate, reliable, and comprehensive datasets. The EPA provides reliable air quality data for public health assessments, while Open-Meteo offers extensive weather data necessary for environmental analyses.

## Objective
The primary objective of Project ELLYSIUM is to : analyze the relationship between urban temperature variations and air quality, while also aligning these trends with broader climate change projections. The insights gained will contribute to understanding the localized impacts of global climate phenomena, potentially guiding policy and mitigation strategies in urban planning and public health.


This project combines robust data analysis with environmental science to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time, providing a foundation for future research and policy development.


## Data Analysis Questions
1. How have the maximum and minimum temperatures changed over the past 10 years in different urban areas across the U.S.?
   Over the past decade, Los Angeles and Tulsa have seen slight upward trends in both maximum and minimum temperatures, indicating warmer conditions and milder winters, aligning with climate 
   change projections. In contrast, New York's maximum temperatures have remained stable, while minimum temperatures have slightly decreased, suggesting cooler winters. These trends reflect 
   varying climate patterns across the cities, with Los Angeles and Tulsa warming, while New York shows a more complex response with stable maximums and cooler winters.
2. How do variations in maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation correlate with air quality levels in these cities?
   The data from Los Angeles, New York, and Tulsa shows varying correlations between temperature, precipitation, and air quality over the past decade. In Los Angeles, higher maximum temperatures 
   often coincide with increased AQI levels, suggesting poorer air quality during hotter periods, while precipitation has minimal impact. New York displays a weaker correlation between 
   temperature variations and AQI, with some improvement in air quality during wetter years. In Tulsa, there is a slight upward trend in AQI with rising temperatures, though the relationship is 
   less pronounced than in Los Angeles, and precipitation does not strongly correlate with changes in air quality. Overall, the data indicates that temperature has a more significant impact on 
   air quality than precipitation, particularly in Los Angeles.
3. How do the observed trends in maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as precipitation sums, align with climate change projections for the next decade?
   Answer: The tri-graphs for the selected cities (Tulsa, Los Angeles, and New York) reveal seasonal patterns in temperature, with clear cycles of rising and falling temperatures over the years. 
   There are subtle increases in the peaks of maximum temperatures and less pronounced but noticeable changes in minimum temperatures.
   climate warming: The cities analyzed will likely continue to experience warming trends, with more frequent and severe heatwaves. Maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to 
   rise further.
   Weather variation: Precipitation patterns are likely to become more erratic, with some years experiencing significantly higher or lower than average precipitation, leading to floods and 
   droughts.
   These trends emphasize the need for cities to adapt to changing climate conditions, by improving heat resilience, enhancing water management systems, and preparing for more extreme weather 
   events.
