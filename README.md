# Temperature & Air Quality Analysis (Project-1-Elysium)

## Introduction
Project ELYSIUM is an in-depth analysis focusing on the intersection of temperature, precipitation and air quality  patterns across key cities in the United States. By leveraging historical weather data and air quality indices (AQI), this project aims to uncover trends and correlations that can provide valuable insights into the impacts of climate change on urban environments.


## Cities
36.1540, 95.9928 - Tulsa
40.7128, 74.0060 - New York
34.0549, 118.2426 - Los Angeles

## Resources
Historical Weather Data: The data spans from 2014 to 2023, providing daily and quarterly data for temperature, precipitation, and the Air Quality Index (AQI). This extensive dataset, accessible via the Open-Meteo Historical Weather API, allows for a deep dive into historical weather records, helping to identify trends over the past decade.
Air Quality Data: Sourced from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) API, this dataset provides detailed air quality measurements, including key pollutants and AQI values.

We chose data from the EPA and open metro because it is based on accurate, reliable, and comprehensive datasets. The EPA provides reliable air quality data for public health assessments, while Open-Meteo offers extensive weather data necessary for environmental analyses.

## Objective
The primary objective of Project ELLYSIUM is to : analyze the relationship between urban temperature variations and air quality, while also aligning these trends with broader climate change projections. The insights gained will contribute to understanding the localized impacts of global climate phenomena, potentially guiding policy and mitigation strategies in urban planning and public health.


This project combines robust data analysis with environmental science to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time, providing a foundation for future research and policy development.


## Data Analysis Questions
1. How have the maximum and minimum temperatures changed over the past 10 years in different urban areas across the U.S.?
2. How do variations in maximum and minimum temperatures correlate with air quality levels in urban areas?
3. How do the observed trends in maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as precipitation sums, align with climate change projections for the next decade?
